IDEA/WebStorm Smooth Scroll
====================

This is a simple plugin for IntelliJ IDEA and WebStorm which animates the scroll offset of the file
editors in order to achieve a smooth scrolling experience.

I created the plugin because I was getting really annoyed with the editor jumping a couple lines for
every mouse wheel click. Maybe you've felt the same way. Now the scroll is really smooth and also
has acceleration which means you can fling the code up or down almost as if you were on a tablet or
on mobile phone.

Currently, the configuration values are built in and are adjusted to work with my own Microsoft
optical mouse. If more people are interested in the plugin, I can make the configuration parameters
adjustable through a configuration file or through a custom UI inside IDEA/WebStorm.

I haven't tested the plugin in other JetBrains products like PhpStorm, PyCharm or RubyMine, but I
guess it should probably work in those as well.

If you have any feedback or if you would like to contribute with some improvements, that would be
awesome.
